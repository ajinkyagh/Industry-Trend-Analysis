## Project Overview

**Objectives**

* Clean and prepare a large organizational dataset for analysis
* Identify industry patterns and employee trends through EDA
* Apply clustering, classification, regression, and text mining
* Visualize insights with clear and interpretable charts

**Why This Project Matters**

* Industry leaders rely on data-driven insights for workforce planning, trend forecasting, and market positioning
* This project highlights the ability to combine **data engineering**, **machine learning**, and **analytics** for real-world business problems

## Methodology

### 1. Data Wrangling

* Loaded and cleaned data from CSV (10,000 records)
* Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized text fields
* Produced descriptive summaries of dataset structure

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Summarized numerical fields and distributions
* Value counts for categorical columns (Industry, Country)
* Correlation matrix for numeric features

### 3. Data Mining Techniques

* **Cluster Analysis**

  * Standardized numerical fields: `Founded` and `Number of employees`
  * Applied **KMeans clustering**
  * Reduced dimensions using PCA and visualized clusters

* **Classification**

  * Applied **Naive Bayes Classifier** to predict "Industry" for top 5 industries
  * Evaluated results with classification report and confusion matrix

* **Regression**

  * Used **Linear Regression** to predict employee counts from founded year
  * Analyzed regression coefficients and model performance

* **Text Mining**

  * Implemented **TF-IDF** to extract key terms from organization descriptions
  * Identified most frequent words that define industries

### 4. Data Visualization

* Bar chart: Top 10 industries by number of organizations
* Pie chart: Top 5 countries by number of organizations
* Boxplot: Distribution of employees across industries
* Line chart: Average employees over time
* Multi-line chart: Employee growth in top 5 industries
* Scatter plot: Relationship between founding year and employee count

---

## Results Summary

* **Cluster Analysis:** Revealed distinct organizational groupings by size and founding year
* **Classification:** Reasonable accuracy in predicting industry categories
* **Regression:** Showed employee growth trends relative to organizational age
* **Text Mining:** Highlighted important descriptive terms across industries
